# Flaky Survey
## The survey app that lets you change your mind

This is a basic survey app built in Rails 5. To use, run:

`rails db:migrate`
`rails s`

You should then be able to head straight to `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser and start doing stuff.

Lots of undocumented bugs in this version, but basic functions work if you're careful. You can:

* Create an account
* Sign in and out
* View a list of all surveys
* View a list of your surveys
* Respond to any survey that isn't yours
* View all of your responses
* Change your responses after submitting
